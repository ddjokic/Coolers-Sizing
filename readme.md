<h4> Coolers sizing script </h4>

filename: cooler_size.py </p>
language: python </p>
<u>synonyms:</u> "Hot fluid" - "inner" fluid, fluid which is actually cooling equipment. In results refered as "Coolant";</p>
"Cold fluid" - outer fluid which actualy cooling "Hot Fluid". </p>

Using script as is may require lot of typing, depending on number of cooled equipment. Usually, I edit script to set "default" values and than coll them on a prompt by typing "0".</p>

Resuslts are printed in "projectname.txt", "tab" delimited file. Import result file in spreadsheet program - looks better in reports.
